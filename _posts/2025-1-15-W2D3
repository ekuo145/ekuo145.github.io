What is my reaction to the U.S. removing malware allegedly planted on computers by Chinese-backed hackers. I think it is good to know that the government cares about getting rid of malware, but I'm kind of surprised it took them this long.
The virus is said to have been used since 2013 so despite it being on a smaller number of devices, I'm surprised it took them this long to find out about it. It makes me wonder what type of computers were compromised, like if it was government devices or that of researchers.  
I also wonder how they found the infrastructure for PlugX, and if it wasn't in the U.S. or France, how they went about taking it over. Finally, I think that being able to completely purge the virus once you take control of the infrastructure is a pretty cool countermeasure, sending self-destruct commands to each piece of malware.
