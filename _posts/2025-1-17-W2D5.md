*My response to the Willow Pays Leaks*  
I think it is poor practice to have this kind of data breach nowadays. Databases containing significant customer information like financial records should never be kept unprotected, and a password is the bare minimum. The biggest failure is that when these security researchers discover a vulnerability, they cannot say if someone else has accessed the data. The article cites too much trust in web service providers as the main reason for this type of vulnerability, but I think it is pure cost-cutting or laziness.
The web service providers like Amazon will not secure *your* app for you, so it feels like companies instead just want to cut costs or meet deadlines. A leak like this is massive, both for the reputation of the company and the users, and I hope companies start securing their databases with passwords and other measures at least.
