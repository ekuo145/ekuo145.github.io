Write a paragraph about what part of cybersecurity most interests you and what you hope to learn in this course.
Cybersecurity sems like it would be fun to learn, and I'm most interested in trying to navigate different computer systems and use Linux. I hope to learn about how different types of viruses and hacks work. I'd also want to learn different methods to defend the system if it has been compromised, and what that process looks like. Finally, I'd want to learn about navigating linux and potentially how operating systems work, like if when you are editing things in the mac finder if it passes messages to Linux/interprets your clicks.
