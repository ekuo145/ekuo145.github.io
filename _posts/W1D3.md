Why do I want to learn cybersecurity?

Cybersecurity seems like it would be fun to learn, and I'm most interested in navigating different computer systems and using **Linux**. I want to learn about how different types of viruses and hacks work. I'd also want to learn different methods to defend the system if it has been compromised, and what that process looks like. Finally, I'd like to learn about navigating Linux and how operating systems work, like if when you are editing things in the Mac finder it passes messages to Linux/interprets your clicks.
