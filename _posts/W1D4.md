United States Cyber Trust Mark Press Release

I like that the government is getting involved in helping to verify that companies have taken appropriate cybersecurity measures. It gives these companies more of an incentive to not cut costs in that department though I do think that it will probably lose a lot of its prestige when eventually one of the products under the label gets hacked. I think there will be a big misunderstanding about this mark, thinking that it will mean it never gets hacked but I don't think that is realistic. It will contribute to the growing cybersecurity industry though as I think it will transform it in a way that products will need this mark to be sold/be successful. Companies will still try to meet the bare minimum to get this mark, but at least that bar has been raised now.

This blog may take a while to upload, if you want to see things quicker, there is a live demo on my [github](https://github.com/ekuo145/ekuo145.github.io/tree/master/_posts)
